 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The objective is to analyze a real-world dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present them through interactive dashboards and business-ready reports.

The project covers:

* Data loading and exploration using Python
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* SQL-based analysis using relational databases
* Dashboard development in Power BI
* Insight reporting and presentation using Gamma

---

 Dataset

* Source: CSV file (can be replaced with any similar dataset)
* Type: Structured data
* Contents include:

  * Customer, sales, or transaction-related information
  * Dates, categories, and numerical metrics

The dataset is used for learning and demonstration purposes only.

---

 Tools & Technologies

* Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Databases:

  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
  * SQL Server
* SQL: Queries, joins, aggregations, filters
* Power BI: Data modeling, visualization, dashboards
* Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook, pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench, Power BI Desktop

 Project Workflow / Steps

 1. Data Loading (Python)

* Imported the dataset using Pandas
* Reviewed dataset structure, columns, and data types

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Summary statistics
* Missing value analysis
* Outlier detection
* Trend and distribution analysis using visualizations

 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicate records
* Corrected data types
* Standardized column names and values

 4. SQL Analysis

* Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server
* Executed analytical queries including:

  * Filtering and aggregation
  * Joins and subqueries
  * Business-focused insights

 5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

* Connected Power BI to SQL database
* Built KPIs, charts, and interactive filters
* Designed a clean and business-oriented dashboard

 6. Reporting & Presentation

* Created a data analysis report summarizing insights
* Developed a presentation using Gamma for stakeholder communication

---

 Dashboard

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Category-wise and time-based analysis
* Trend and comparison visuals
* Interactive slicers for dynamic insights

---

 Results & Insights

* Identified important trends and patterns
* Highlighted high-performing and underperforming segments
* Generated actionable insights to support data-driven decisions
